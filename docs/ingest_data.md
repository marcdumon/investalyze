## 1. Provider responsibilities

Each asset class has **exactly one** source. No multi-source overlap on the same instrument.

| Provider | Owns | Datasets |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Yahoo** (`yfinance`) | Stock prices | OHLCV, dividends, splits |
| **SimFin** (bulk REST) | Fundamentals | income, balance, cashflow — **as-filed + restated** (US) |
| **Stooq** (manual download) | Bonds, currencies, indices | OHLC(V) |

Design rule ✅: a provider is a self-contained module. Adding a 4th provider must not touch the
others. More providers expected later.

> Change from old `dataload`: Stooq no longer supplies **stock** prices (its stock data isn't
> dividend-adjusted → poor quality). Yahoo owns all equities; Stooq is scoped to non-equity.

## 2. Provider detail

### 2.1 Yahoo — stock prices ✅ (built)
- **Acquire:** `yfinance`, batched `yf.download(auto_adjust=False, actions=True, group_by='ticker')`.
  `batch_size`/`sleep` come from `[yahoo]` in `ingest.toml`. Dividends/splits come from the same
  download (`Dividends`, `Stock Splits` columns) — no separate `yf.Ticker.actions` call.
- **Fields:** `Open, High, Low, Close, Volume` → stored as `O, H, L, C, V`; `Dividends`/`Stock Splits`
  → `dividends`/`splits` event tables.
- **Adjustment** ✅: store **raw** OHLCV + our own derived adjusted close (`AC`), back-adjusted from
  raw close + events (not Yahoo's, not `auto_adjust`). Validated against Yahoo's `Adj Close` at
  `ac_tolerance` (0.1%) during ingest. A new dividend/split rewrites the ticker's whole `AC` history,
  recomputed cheaply from stored raw + events (no re-download).
- **Update:** incremental — one batched call per batch starting `refetch_days` (`ingest.toml [yahoo]`,
  default 7) before the earliest stored date across the batch (full history if any ticker is new).
  The trailing overlap deliberately re-fetches the last few days so a **provisional** close (e.g. an
  11am run stores the intraday price as that day's `C`) and any later provider revision get overwritten
  by the finalized values on the next update — idempotent via merge upsert on `[Ticker, Date]`.
  *Caveat:* this self-heals only going forward. Rows written before this behaviour existed (the old
  logic started at `last + 1 day` and never re-touched the provisional day) are sealed stale and fall
  outside the window — reconcile them once with a full (non-`--update`) reload.
- **Symbol mapping:** canonical ticker → Yahoo symbol can differ (e.g. preferred `ARRY_A` →
  `ARRY-PA`). For equities the canonical usually equals the Yahoo symbol.
- **State** ✅: delisted / no-data tickers recorded in `state/price_blacklist.csv` (with an `attempts`
  counter) and skipped on later runs; AC sanity-check offenders written to
  `state/ac_discrepancies.csv` (non-fatal). The `housekeeping` command (see §5) retries blacklisted
  tickers, reviving ones that return data again and moving chronic failures (past
  `blacklist_max_attempts`) to `state/price_dead.csv`, never retried again.
- **Metadata** ✅ (built): a separate provider, `yahoo-meta` (`python -m investalyze.ingest -p
  yahoo-meta`), fetches `yf.Ticker(t).info` per ticker -> `_yahoo_companies` (one row/ticker: address,
  website, industry/sector, business summary, employee count, governance risk scores) +
  `company_officers` (one row/officer) — see §7. Reuses this provider's ticker universe and
  blacklist/dead exclusions; tracks its own metadata-fetch failures independently in
  `data/yahoo/state/meta_blacklist.csv` / `meta_dead.csv` (no subdir of its own — it lives under
  the price provider's tree). Refreshed per ticker once its `FetchedOn` is older than
  `refresh_days_meta` (`ingest.toml [yahoo-meta]`).

### 2.2 SimFin — fundamentals ✅ (built)
- **Acquire:** bulk ZIPs from SimFin REST API (auth `api-key` header → presigned S3 redirect; auth not
  forwarded to S3), refreshed by file age (`refresh_days_fundamentals`, `refresh_days_meta`). No
  incremental feed — `--update` is governed by file age, same as a full run. API key from env
  **`SIMFIN_API_KEY`** (e.g. `.env`), never config.
- **Scope:** `us` market only (de excluded — re-addable, the `Market` column + keys already carry it).
  Statements `income`, `balance`, `cashflow`. `derived` (SimFin's pre-computed ratios) **excluded** —
  recomputable downstream.
- **Vintages** ✅: as-reported (original) + restated (latest revised), folded into one boolean
  `IsRestated` column (`False`/`True`), NOT separate `_restated` tables. Verified the two vintages are
  schema-identical per statement (income 68 / balance 95 / cashflow 62 cols), so the union folds with
  no NULL columns.
- **Granularity:** Annual (`A`) + Quarterly (`Q`), in one `Period` column.
- **Tables:** `income`/`balance`/`cashflow` — wide source columns **verbatim** + added `Market`,
  `Period`, `IsRestated`, `Src` (`simfin`), `SrcId` (renamed `SimFinId`). `_simfin_companies` —
  per-market companies `LEFT JOIN industries` (Industry/Sector folded in); the raw SimFin metadata
  table, merged into the combined `companies` table by the `companies` housekeeping task. Merge keys:
  fundamentals `[Ticker, Market, Period, IsRestated, 'Fiscal Year', 'Fiscal Period']`,
  `_simfin_companies` `[Ticker, Market]`.
- **Temporal columns** ✅: rows carry `Fiscal Year`, `Fiscal Period`, `Report Date`, `Publish Date`,
  `Restated Date` → **point-in-time is feasible** (original-as-published + latest restated, split by
  `IsRestated`).
- **Format:** semicolon-delimited CSVs inside the zips; wide, source-defined columns (kept verbatim).

### 2.3 Stooq — bonds, currencies, indices ✅
- **Acquire:** NOT programmatic. User manually downloads from stooq.com and drops files in raw dir.
  **Two inputs, two read paths** ✅ (both → `market_data`, both saved via the merge/upsert so they converge):
  | Input | Use | Format | AssetClass from |
  |-------|-----|--------|-----------------|
  | **`d_world_txt.zip`** (bulk) | full history | folder tree `world/<category>/[sub]/<ticker>.txt` | **folder name** (`_asset_class_from_category`) |
  | **`data_d.txt`** (flat) | daily update | one file, all instruments, no category | **ticker pattern** (`_asset_class_from_ticker`) |
  - **Skip `d_us_txt.zip`** ✅ — that's US equities (Yahoo owns them).
- **Raw row format:** `<TICKER>,<PER>,<DATE>,<TIME>,<OPEN>,<HIGH>,<LOW>,<CLOSE>,<VOL>,<OPENINT>`,
  comma-delimited; date `YYYYMMDD`; VOL always 0.
- **Ticker-pattern classification** (flat file, no folders) ✅:
  `.B`→bonds · `^`→indices · bare 6-letter alpha→currencies · drop `.US`/`.V`/other.
  Fuzzy at edges ❓ — the ~1,248 "other" (money market/commodities) and the 6-letter=fx assumption.
- **Bonds = two series** ✅: yield (`10YUSY.B`) + price (`10YUSP.B`), both `AssetClass='bonds'`,
  distinguished by ticker (Y vs P). Exchange suffix `.B` stripped in transform → `10YUSY` / `10YUSP`.

---

## 3. Universe (ticker registry)

- `universe.csv` columns: `Ticker` (canonical), `Market`, `stooq_ticker`, `yahoo_ticker`.
- Old seed: built from Stooq `markets.csv`, deduped by **market tier** (equities outrank
  crypto/fx/bonds so an equity never gets shadowed by a colliding crypto symbol).
- `BANNED_MARKETS = {cryptocurrencies}` — never seeded, fetched, or stored.
- 🔶 With the new clean asset-class split, the universe model may change — the canonical ticker and
  per-asset-class identity need redesign (separate equity vs bond/fx/index namespaces?).

---

## 4. ETL / cleaning (known facts)

- **Crypto:** banned at the source; never enters the DB.
- **Stooq stocks:** dropped (unadjusted → unreliable). Keep only bonds/fx/indices.
- **Delisted:** track per-ticker fetch success/failure; don't keep re-querying dead Yahoo tickers.
- **Column normalization:** sources use different names (Stooq `<OPEN>...`, Yahoo `Open...`) →
  canonical column set per dataset.
- **Side-effect discipline** ✅ (architecture goal): acquire → land raw (immutable) → transform
  (pure/testable) → validate → load. No side effects interleaved with logic.
- **Persistent manual fixes** ✅ (built): source-wrong data (e.g. `^NDX` pre-1985-10-02 proxy
  history) is corrected in the DB itself, not filtered at read time. Since ingest only
  merge-upserts, a full reload resurrects deleted rows; fixes live in `cleaning.toml` (one
  entry per instance, one module per fix type in `src/investalyze/cleaning/`) and are
  re-applied manually via `python -m investalyze.cleaning check` / `apply` (see manual.md).
  Evidence per fix is logged in `notebooks/9999_data_quirks.ipynb`.

## 5. Housekeeping

`python -m investalyze.ingest housekeeping` runs maintenance tasks against the ingest state,
separate from the regular provider ingest. Tasks are selectable with `-t/--task` (repeatable;
default: all).

| Task | Does |
|------|------|
| `yahoo-blacklist` | Retries every ticker in `data/yahoo/state/price_blacklist.csv`. Tickers that return data again are removed from the blacklist and added back to `ticker.csv` (picked up by the next regular ingest run, not ingested by housekeeping itself). Tickers still empty get `attempts` incremented; past `blacklist_max_attempts` (`ingest.toml [yahoo]`, default 5) they move to `data/yahoo/state/price_dead.csv` and are never retried again. `ticker.csv` is pruned of anything still blacklisted or now dead on every run. |
| `yahoo-meta-blacklist` | Same recheck/age-out pattern as `yahoo-blacklist`, against `data/yahoo/state/meta_blacklist.csv`/`meta_dead.csv` (independent of the price provider's lists — `yahoo-meta` tracks its own metadata-fetch failures, alongside them in the same dir). A revived ticker is simply unblacklisted; the next `yahoo-meta` run re-fetches it naturally (no ticker.csv of its own to prune). |
| `companies` | Rebuilds the combined `companies` table (`CREATE OR REPLACE`) from `_yahoo_companies` `FULL OUTER JOIN _simfin_companies` on `Ticker`. One row per ticker with `InYahoo`/`InSimfin` flags; Yahoo wins the overlapping fields (Industry, Sector, NrEmployees, BusinessSummary). |

---

## 6. Directory structure ✅ (`./data`)

**Provider-first**: each provider owns one self-contained subtree and creates only its own folder.
The DB is shared and lives outside every provider tree. A provider never touches another's data.

```
data/
├── investalyze.duckdb          # the one DB — shared, outside provider trees
├── universe.csv                # cross-provider registry (or move into DB) 🔶
├── yahoo/
│   ├── raw/                     # immutable landed source artifacts (never mutated)
│   ├── processed/               # canonical parquet, regenerable from raw (safe to wipe)
│   └── state/                   # markers, per-ticker success/failure, resume cursors;
│                                #   also yahoo-meta's meta_blacklist.csv/meta_dead.csv (no subdir of its own)
├── simfin/
│   ├── raw/   processed/   state/
└── stooq/
    ├── raw/   processed/   state/
```

- **Dirs are scaffolded once, up front** ✅ by `orchestrator.create_data_dirs(config)` (terminal:
  `python -m investalyze.ingest setup`). It builds `data/<provider>/{raw,processed,state}/` for every
  **registered** provider, idempotently — run it, then drop the manual source files into `raw/`.
  (Storage stays config-free plumbing; the orchestrator is the one place that reads config.)
- `raw/` immutable · `processed/` regenerable · `state/` holds all resume/freshness/log metadata
  (kept out of raw & processed so neither carries side-effect state — fixes the old scattered-JSON mess).

> The investalyze `data` dir is **decoupled** from the old project's data — fresh start, no inherited files.

---

## 7. DB architecture 🔶 (evolving)

- **Engine:** DuckDB. **Target file:** `data/investalyze.duckdb` ✅ (fresh, decoupled from `irp.duckdb`).
- **Price data is split by role, not unified** ✅ — main vs secondary, one source per table:

  | Table | Source | Role | Columns |
  |-------|--------|------|---------|
  | `prices` ✅ | Yahoo | **main** — prediction target, joins fundamentals | Ticker, Date, O, H, L, C, V, AC |
  | **`market_data`** ✅ | Stooq | **secondary / features** — bonds, indices, currencies | `Ticker, Date, O, H, L, C, AssetClass` |
  | `income`/`balance`/`cashflow` ✅ | SimFin | **fundamentals** — wide statements | source cols + Market, Period, IsRestated, Src, SrcId |
  | `companies` ✅ | **combined** (Yahoo + SimFin) | **metadata** — one merged row per ticker, rebuilt by the `companies` housekeeping task | Ticker, InYahoo, InSimfin, Industry, Sector, NrEmployees, CompanyName, Address, City, State, Zip, Country, ISIN, CIK, Website, IRWebsite, BusinessSummary |
  | `_yahoo_companies` ✅ | Yahoo | **raw metadata** — profile fields from `yf.Ticker.info` (one row/ticker) | Ticker, Src, Address1, City, State, Zip, Country, Website, Industry, Sector, BusinessSummary, FullTimeEmployees, AuditRisk, BoardRisk, CompensationRisk, ShareholderRightsRisk, OverallRisk, IRWebsite, FetchedOn |
  | `_simfin_companies` ✅ | SimFin | **raw metadata** — companies ⨝ industries | Ticker, SrcId, Src, Market, Industry, Sector, CompanyName, IndustryId, ISIN, FinancialYearEndMonth, NumberEmployees, BusinessSummary, CIK, MainCurrency |
  | `company_officers` ✅ | Yahoo | **metadata** — one row per officer | Ticker, Src, Name, Title, Age, YearBorn, FiscalYear, TotalPay, ExercisedValue, UnexercisedValue |

  `dividends(Ticker, Date, Dividend)` and `splits(Ticker, Date, Ratio)` carry the events. `AC` is
  our adjusted close, computed from raw close + events (not Yahoo's, not stored adjusted) and
  validated against Yahoo's `Adj Close` at 0.1% during ingest.

  - **Short column names** ✅: `O/H/L/C` (not Open/High/Low/Close).
  - `market_data` has **no volume** (always 0 for these instruments).
  - **`AssetClass`** ∈ {bonds, currencies, indices} — derived from the Stooq source category dir.
  - **Bonds = two tickers**: yield (`10YUSY`) + price (`10YUSP`), both `AssetClass='bonds'`.
- **Fundamentals** ✅: one table per statement, both vintages in a boolean `IsRestated` column (the old
  `_restated` shadow tables are retired). Point-in-time via `Publish Date`/`Restated Date` + `IsRestated`.
- **Still to design:**
  - Per-dataset **column contract** (no silently drifting wide SimFin tables).
